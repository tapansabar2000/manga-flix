Animeflix is an web application parodying the Netflix frontend, but with animes only, solely made to practice how to build a responsive layout with HTML, css and JavaScript in React as well as how to read data from a third party API. It works like a catalogue, consuming real anime data from the [Kitsu API](https://kitsu.docs.apiary.io/), allowing users to search through Kitsu catalogue, list various animes, read a brief description about each of them, list all episodes registered in the API and watch trailers. 

I haven't used any package or framework with read to use visual elements except the Material UI icons package. Buttons, navbars, dropdown list, menus, page transitions and other visual components was made by me from scratch. The trickiest component to build was the modal, which I'm not entirely happy with, but I managed to get a very decent result.

Some buttons are just placeholders since I can't recreate exactly the same behaviors with a compleat different backend, all the mentioned functionalities do works though. I just didn't wanted to expend more time coding an extra layer of backend just to fill minor gaps in this project specifically.
